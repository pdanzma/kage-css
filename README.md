## Overview

kagi-css is a custom CSS file to beautify and liven up the Kagi search engine interface. With this stylesheet, you can enjoy a more visually appealing and dynamic search experience while using Kagi. Mainly inspired by Google and Brave Search, but with many exciting innovations of its own!

## Features

- **Glassmorphism**: A glass-inspired design for the settings and navigation bar
- **Documentation**: This css file has been documented quite accurately, which is why it is relatively easy to make changes
- **Custom Animations**: Smooth transitions and eye-catching effects
- **Enhanced UI Elements**: Improved buttons, search bar, and results layout
- **Responsive Design**: Looks great on both desktop and mobile devices
- **Easy color changes**: There is a field at the beginning where you can easily change the most important colors as you wish
- **Uniform Design**: The design now extends to almost all pages, be it results, images, videos, news or podcasts.

## Installation

1. Download the `custom.css` file from this repository.
2. Enable custom CSS in Kagi Settings.
3. Paste the code into the inputfield at: [Link](https://kagi.com/settings?p=custom_css)

## Animations

kagi-css includes several animations to make your search experience more dynamic:

1. **Results Fade-In**: Search results smoothly fade in as they load.
2. **Hover Effects**: Buttons and links have pleasant hover transitions.
3. **Search Tiles**: Also have beautiful animations.

## Any ideas / comments?

If you have an idea that would extend / complete the look of Kagi or if you have found a bug, please write to me on Discord or write in Discord: kagi-discussions -> “UI Design Ideas for my custom css”. [Link](https://discord.com/channels/1256077108111868035/1265596713083732060)

## Concerns

Unfortunately, I keep hitting the character limit, which is why the custom.css file looks so compressed. Even with the latest update, I couldn't implement every idea due to this limitation. That's why I plan to structure the CSS modularly, so you can pick and choose the building blocks you need. There will still be an all-in-one solution, but it won't include all modifications. Please bear with me.

# Enjoy your enhanced Kagi search experience!
